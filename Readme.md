To Run Backend

Change the directory to the: cd backend

Installation command: npm install

Run Command: npm start / nodemon server.js

Backend was working as per the requirement with the Role based pages and role based archtiecture

Mainly In admin point of view he will approve the records created by  the department 

In department point of view they will add records and with status pending 

Only admin has the access to change the status of a record


There are some glitches in the frontend I'm mentioning the Endpoints of the frontend

For User login: "/login"
For User Registration: "/registration"
For Admin Login: "/admin-login"

And home page: "/" user have the options to create or get all requests

And for admin i've created a endpoint only where he can approve the request

Endpoint: "/admin-tasks-approval"



Due to lack of time failed to add more functionalites in frontend. Since Backend working as per the requirement mentioned in the task
